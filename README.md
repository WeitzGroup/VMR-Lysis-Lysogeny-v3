Code for: Lysis, Lysogeny, and Virus-Microbe Ratios
=============================

A recent paper by Knowles et al. 2016 claims to find evidence to support the piggyback-the-winner (PtW) hypothesis, which implies that cell lysis is suppressed when microbial density is high, due to a greater prevalence of lysogeny; and that this is an explanation for the negative relationship between microbial densities and the virus-to-microbial cell ratio. We (Weitz et al., 2016) re-evaluate both the data and model used in support of PtW. This repository contains codes for creating the figures used to support our response to the findings of Knowles et al.
