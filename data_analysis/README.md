Virome evaluation
=============================


Virome data presented in Knowles et al. 2016 figure 4a, 4b and Extended figure 4a is evaluated using R (version 3.3.1) and packages *boot* (version 1.3-18), *MASS* (version 7.3-45) and *robustbase* (version 0.92-6).

## Data

To perform the analysis first you will need to aquire the data aquired by Knowles et al. 2016 from [doi:10.1038/nature17193](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17193).
The data used by **Figure 4** should be placed within this folder as:
 * *nature17193-f4.csv*  

Similarly, the data  used by **Extended Figure 4a** should be placed within this folder as:
 * *nature17193-sf4.csv*  

## Analysis

#1:
 * *viromePanel.R*   &nbsp; - &nbsp;   script to plot the lysogeny hallmark gene relationships presented in Knowles et al. This script creates Figure 1 in our manuscript.


#2:
 * *DataAnalysis.R*   &nbsp; - &nbsp;   script to load and prepare data for analysis using bootstrap methods
 * *CItesting.R*   &nbsp; - &nbsp;   function called by DataAnalysis.R to perform bootstrap analysis and return confidence intervals

To perform the analysis (once the data has been aquired and placed in this folder) start R in this folder and run:

```r
	source("DataAnalysis.R")
```


## Outputs
The analysis for each dataset shown below returns a table displaying the method used, Zeroes -- the number of datapoints (out of 24) assigned a weighting of zero by each method, the sample size -- the number of members of a bootstrap ensemble (out of 10,000) which successfully converged and the 95% confidence intervals calculated from these members of the bootstrap ensemble.

 * *PProphage.csv*   &nbsp; - &nbsp;   Table returning the results of the analysis for the relationship between log10(microbial abundance per ml) and percentage pro-virus like reads in viromes
 * *Integrase.csv*   &nbsp; - &nbsp;   Table returning the results of the analysis for the relationship between log10(microbial abundance per ml) and percentage integrase reads in viromes
 * *Excisionase.csv*   &nbsp; - &nbsp;   Table returning the results of the analysis for the relationship between log10(microbial abundance per ml) and percentage excisionase reads in viromes

within these tables *coefficient* details the relevant correlation or slope coefficient, *pval* is the corresponding p-value of that coefficient. *Zeros* indicates the number of datapoints (out of 24) that are downweighted by each robust regression technique to have 0 influence in the corresponding analysis. *bootstrap sample size* shows the number of bootstrap replicates which converged (of a possible 10,000) and are used to calculate 95% confidence intervals using the bootstrapped BCa (bias-corrected and accelerated) method (Efron, 1987) shown in the columns headed *bootstrap CI*.
